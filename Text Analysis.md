# Challenging Assumptions: Text Analysis for Understanding Historical Papers 

## Introduction 
- For this assignment I took two articles related to my masters thesis research. The topics are quite different, but they still fit with my research. 
- I applied the tools [Voyant](http://voyant-tools.org/) and [AntConc](http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software.html) to each article to view similarities and differences between the two. 

## The Texts 
- The first article I used is called [Looking for Jiro Onuma: A Queer Meditation on the Incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II](http://glq.dukejournals.org/content/20/3/241.abstract)
- The second article I used is called [The Future of the Past: Digital Media in Holocaust Museums](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17504902.2014.11435374)

# Voyant 

## Word Clouds
- I first plugged the two articles in separately into Voyant to see if there were any similarities. The word cloud that was produced gave me interesting results! 
- The most frequent words in each article were very different: 
	- Looking for Jiro Onuma: Japannese, Onuma, American 
	- The Future of the Past: Holocaust, Digital, Museum 
- When I took a closer look at the less frequent words I noticed some connections (that may or may not be huge stretches in terms of actual similarities). 
	- Looking for Jiro Onuma: Personal, Photography, History, Visual
	- The Future of the Past: Media, Memory, Representation, Testimony
- I know that these words must be reviewed within the context of the sentence in which they reside. What is interesting are the connections I made between the two articles that I may not have made after simply reading them. Voyant as a tool for text analysis allows us to think "outside the paper" at connections between themes and topics within academic papers. 

## Word Frequencies 
- I have to say that using this aspect of Voyant crushed my dreams of finding unique connections between the articles. 
- I typed in four words to compare the frequency of each word in the articles. Two of the words were related to one article, the other two were related to the other: 
	- Looking for Jiro Onuma: Japanese, Queer 
	- The Future of the Past: Holocaust, Camp
- As you can see The Future of the Past not once had Queer or Japanese in the text (come on!) while Looking for Jiro Onuma had the word Camp quite a few times. This wasn't surprising, and it made me rethink my original word choice. Of course an article about the Incarceration of Japanese Americans would have the word Camp in it. What intrigued me was the use of the word Holocaust in Looking for Jiro Onuma! Yet, once I looked at the article I realized it was a bibliographic reference. 
- I would not recommend using word frequencies for finding connections between papers. Just because a word is frequent or appears in a paper, does not indicate much more than its presence in the paper. 

# Ant Conc
- I changed the articles from PDF format to a .txt file using [Atom](https://atom.io/), eliminated all titles, page numbers etc. I then plugged the files separately into Atom to view the various topics in each article. Below are the lists of topics for each article: 
- There were similarities in the topics, but I found it hard to find those connections, it was much easier in the more visually appealing word cloud or word frequency chart. 
- I then decided I would go back to Voyant and do a comparative analysis. I plugged in both lists of topics and used the word cloud lists as the text. Below are the results: 
- If you compare the Looking for Jiro Onuma using Voyant with AntConc&Voyant it provides very different results. A lot of the words are not in the AntConc&Voyant image (Onuma, Japanese, American) 
- This was less apparent in comparing the images from the article The Future of the Past (Digital, but Holocaust remains a prominent word) 
- I am curious about what these results mean for the tools and their application in text analysis, especially when comparing historical papers. Please comment with your thoughts!
